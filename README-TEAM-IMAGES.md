# Team Member Images Setup

To complete the Team page setup, please add the following:

1. Create a folder called `team` inside the `demo/public` directory
2. Add the following images to the `team` folder:
   - `emma.jpg` - Image for Emma Thompson (Founder & Creative Director)
   - `lucas.jpg` - Image for Lucas Harris (Senior Architect)
   - `isabella.jpg` - Image for Isabella Lee (Client Relations Manager)

The images should ideally be square (1:1 aspect ratio) and will be displayed in grayscale as shown in the design.

## Alternative Solution

If you prefer not to create these specific images, you can modify the `About.jsx` file to use placeholder images from a service like:

```jsx
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x400" alt="Emma Thompson" />
```

Or use stock photos from services like Unsplash:

```jsx
<img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random/400x400/?portrait" alt="Emma Thompson" />
```
